Hi! I am a PhD student at the [Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA-CSIC)](https://www.iaa.csic.es/) in Granada, Spain, within the ERC-funded THIRSTEE project under the supervision of [Rafael Luque](https://exoplanet.observer/). THIRSTEE targets sub-Neptunes, combining precise masses and radii with atmospheric follow-up to understand their composition and formation pathways. My specific research focuses on radial-velocity analysis and stellar-activity modelling to obtain very precise mass measurements for these exoplanets, thereby fulfilling the goals of THIRSTEE.


Before the PhD, I did my Master in my home town at the Université de Montréal under the umbrella of the [Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iREx)](https://exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/en/). I was supervised by Prof. [David Lafrenière](https://exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/en/team-member/david-lafreniere/) and was also part of the [NIRPS](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/36/nirps/) consortium. By combining HARPS and NIRPS radial velocities, I refined the mass and density of GJ 3090 b and confirmed a non-transiting sub-Neptune, GJ 3090 c, despite its orbital period being close to the star's rotation period. The analysis uses multidimensional Gaussian Processes to separate planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling robust characterization in challenging datasets. This work culminated in my first 1st-author [peer-reviewed paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2601.09330), which was the second transit follow-up (WP2) paper of the NIRPS consortium. During this time, I have also contributed to other studies as a co-author, which can be found in the [publications](/publications/) section.


During my undergrad, I also did an internship at iREx in which I worked on the [JWST/NIRISS](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/acd7a3/meta) simulator and data reduction pipeline and on the [Dragonfly telescope transit follow-up program](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ade00b), and I remain active in science outreach.
