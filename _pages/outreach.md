I care deeply about science communication and making astronomy accessible. Here are some outreach activities I have participated in:

* **ASTROLab (Parc national du Mont-Megantic)** — Guide-animateur, leading public astronomy activities and observing sessions.
* **Student mentoring and outreach** — Activities with secondary school and CEGEP students to share research pathways in astrophysics.
* **Public-facing astronomy activities** — Regular involvement in events that connect research to broad audiences.

If you are organizing an outreach event, workshop, or public talk, feel free to contact me.
