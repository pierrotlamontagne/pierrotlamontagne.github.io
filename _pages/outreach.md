I care deeply about science communication and making astronomy accessible. Here are some outreach activities I have participated in:

* **ASTROLab (Parc national du Mont-Mégantic)** — Guide-animateur, leading public astronomy activities and observing sessions.
* **Festival d’astronomie populaire du Mont-Mégantic (2022)** — Public talk on the James Webb Space Telescope.
* **Student mentoring and outreach** — Activities with secondary school and CEGEP students to share research pathways in astrophysics.

If you are organizing an outreach event, workshop, or public talk, feel free to contact me.
