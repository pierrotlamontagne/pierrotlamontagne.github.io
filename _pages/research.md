My research focuses on detecting and characterizing exoplanets using high-precision radial-velocity (RV) spectroscopy, with an emphasis on careful treatment of stellar activity and instrument systematics. I work at the intersection of observation, inference, and interpretation, connecting measured masses and radii to internal composition and formation pathways.

Research themes
======
* **Joint RV analysis across instruments.** Combining HARPS and NIRPS RVs to improve mass precision and orbital solutions.
* **Stellar activity mitigation.** Statistical modeling to separate planetary signals from rotational and magnetic variability.
* **Planet characterization.** Using density constraints to infer composition, especially for sub-Neptunes and water-rich worlds.

Selected project: GJ 3090 system
======
In my M.Sc. thesis, I analyzed the GJ 3090 system by jointly modeling HARPS and NIRPS radial velocities. This allowed me to refine the mass and density of GJ 3090 b and to confirm the existence of GJ 3090 c, a non-transiting sub-Neptune whose orbital period is close to the stellar rotation period. The study highlights how careful activity modeling enables robust planet detection even in challenging regimes. A public summary is available in [my thesis in 400 words](https://exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/en/my-thesis-in-400-words-pierrot-lamontagne/).
